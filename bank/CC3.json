The benefit is $8,000 ($10,000 - $2,000). Since the cost of Control A ($8,000) equals the benefit, and the goal is risk reduction (mitigation) [21], it is justifiable. Control B costs $12,000 but only saves $10,000, meaning the cost of the control exceeds the benefit, violating the core economic principle of quantitative risk analysis [22, 23].

Compromising the Know and Have factors is a failure of the overall MFA design if they are stolen together, but the statement that the system only used two distinct categories is the most accurate flaw exposed if the token itself was passive and required only the PIN for activation, thus failing to separate Possession and Knowledge effectively in a practical sense. However, based on pure theory (Knows, Haves, Ares), the system correctly used three categories, and the question is tricky. The 'best' answer is Option D, stating the functional categories used: Key Card (Possession) and Retinal Scan (Inherence) are the two distinct categories that defended the system in the end, assuming the PIN failed to protect the key card from being used as a possession factor."
